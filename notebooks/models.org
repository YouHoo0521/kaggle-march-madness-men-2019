* Benchmark Models
- [[./models/benchmark.org][Benchmark Models]]

* ML Pipeline Demo
Here is an example workflow for a single classifier: [[./models/demo_pipeline.org][Pipeline Demo]]
  
We'll want to automate this pipeline process so that we can swap out
the following parts for experimentation
- data processing and feature engineering
- classifier (and hyperparameters)
- post processing or ensemble methods

* Bayesian Inference
An alternative approach to the typical pointwise prediction is to
perform full Bayesian inference. Here is an example implementation of
a logistic regression model in =pystan=: [[./models/bradley_terry.org][Bradley-Terry Model]]

With hierarchical Bayesian inference, we can build complex, but
interpretable models.
