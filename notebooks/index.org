*Update: Our submission (Team Madtown Machine Learning Madness) finished in 3rd place among 866 teams! I'll follow up with a notebook
describing our model and strategy.*

This is the project site for my machine learning project in CS760 at
UW-Madison. My group will take on the [[https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019][Kaggle competition for NCAA
March Madness]]. 

The goal of this competition is to predict winning probabilities for
all matchups in this year's NCAA March Madness tournament. In addition
to this supervised learning task, there is a [[https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019#Competitiveness-Score][side competition for best
exploratory analysis of a competitiveness score]].
