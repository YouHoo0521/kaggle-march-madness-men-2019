I've been interested in sports analytics lately, and I was excited to
learn about a [[https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019][Kaggle competition for NCAA March Madness]]! They compiled and
cleaned lots of useful data which makes life so much more pleasant for
us nerds who like to play with models. Many thanks to Jeff Sonas, Kenneth
Massey, and Kaggle!

The goal of this competition is to predict winning probabilities for
all matchups in this year's NCAA March Madness tournament. What makes
this competition more interesting to me is a side [[https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019#Competitiveness-Score][competition for best

the data analysis is a fun aspect of a data project that can get
overlooked when the sole focus is on predictive power.
