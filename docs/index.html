This is the project site for my machine learning project in CS760 at
UW-Madison. My group will take on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019">Kaggle competition for NCAA
March Madness</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The goal of this competition is to predict winning probabilities for
all matchups in this year's NCAA March Madness tournament. In addition
to this supervised learning task, there is a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019#Competitiveness-Score">side competition for best
exploratory analysis of a competitiveness score</a>.
